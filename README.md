# SPM-RNG-Drop-Calculator
This is the initial public release of the RNG drop calculator I made for the SPM Any% TAS.
This is not yet in a user-friendly usable state, for instance many file paths are still local to my PC, I will have to fix that some day (hello me from 2029 reading this still not having done it yet)
